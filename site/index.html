      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I love building things, whether that be code, hardware, or woodworking. I'm a software engineer by trade, but I'm also a maker. I like woodworking and doing projects around the house, and I love electronics and circuit design and microcontroller programming. Building web applications and websites and teams that build web applications and websites is my passion. I just love building things, that's probably the simplest way to say it.</p>
      <p><strong>If you want to build something cool with me get in touch!</strong></p>
      <p>Outside of building things I'm a family man that loves spending time with my wife and kids, and I'm into cars and racing.</p>

          <h3>Michael Daof</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Working with Dave as my manager showed me what a manager can be -- hands-on, supportive, and very enthusiastic
          about solutioning.</p>
          <p>When I joined his team we were all thrown into a big project with tight deadlines. I attribute his deep technical
          knowledge and 360 support for getting a fresh team up and running to meet the challenge. I honestly thought we were
          taking on too much, but Dave's strong vision and ability to articulate it is what gave us the confidence we needed
          to get the project over the finish line.</p>
          <p>What made his leadership especially memorable was his interest to talk shop and explore progressive solutions
          rather than just favoring the path of least resistance. He understand the Developer Experience and has immediately
          available empathy for the teams he guides. He gets it. I'd work with him again in a heartbeat.</p>

          <h3>Kelvin de Moya</h3>
        </div>
        <span>Dave is the most hands-on and deeply technically-minded manager I've had the pleasure to work with. He was always
          present and actively involved in technical brainstorms and architectural discussions, consistently offering highly
          valuable insight and reviews. All this while managing expectations, roadmapping and organization among all stakeholders.
          <br />
          <br />
          With Dave's leadership and support, I was enabled to build and maintain a GraphQL replacement for an unreliable REST
          data API to support our website, resulting in 66% faster loading times while using just 1% of the original PoC's lambda
          invocations and ended up becoming the main data API across the company, serving tens of millions of requests across
          multiple customer-facing apps and services. He then built a team around that project, which I ended up leading.
          <br />
          <br />
          For me, Dave is the golden standard of what I wish to see in an Engineering Manager, and ever since we parted ways I've
          been looking forward for the day we get to collaborate again.</span>

        </div>
        <span>I had the pleasure of working with Dave at Beachbody, where he was a Senior Engineering Manager and a huge part
          of my growth as a leader and engineer. Dave always made time for me, even early in his mornings to help me with
          questions I had, that were both simple and complex relating to engineering and programming in general. And this
          is why he stands out to me as one of those rare leaders who actually lead by example and always will put
          themselves out for the benefit of their team.
          <br />
          <br />
          I got to see firsthand the level of care and high standards Dave put into every project he worked on. He’s
          someone I’m lucky to call both a colleague and a friend, and I couldn’t recommend him more to any team that
          values both skill and genuine leadership.</span>

        <h3>Discuss</h3>
        <p>Discuss is a simple forum application that I built to learn more about Ruby on Rails and React. It's a simple
          forum application that allows users to create topics and posts, and reply to posts. It's a work in progress, but
          it's a fun project that I'm using to learn more about the technologies I'm using. I run it in a docker container
          on a raspberry pi that sits behind my desk.</p>

        <h3>Burn Baby Burn</h3>
        <p>Burn Baby Burn is a cool open source project I found on GitHub to track the expense of a meeting based on its
          duration and the number of people involved. I started using it and it was good, but there were some features
          that I wanted (like adding and removing people after a meeting has already started, resetting, and keeping a
          history), and as I looked through the code I realized I would need to refactor the codebase to get those
          features implemented, so I forked and did that and opened up a (non-merged) pull request against the original
          with my changes. I run it on GitHub pages.</p>

        <h3>Newsletter Signup</h3>
        <p>At a previous employer we were evaluating whether to use Netlify to deploy one of our applications (conclusion:
          Netlify is an amazing tool built by a great company and you should totally use them, but in a larger org you
          have to balance the cost against the number of teams that would take advantage of it and that particular
          employer opted not to move forward with them). In order to do the evaluation I built a small newsletter signup
          application utilizing Next.js with Netlify functions (essentially like AWS serverless functions) and a FaunaDB
          database as a service backend. Neat project, lots of fun to build, everyone got a chuckle. The company was
          car-focused and most of what they were dealing with was the very top-end, show winner beautiful masterpieces, so
          I took the opposite approach. The newsletter never existed, so no point in signing up, just a
          proof-of-concept.</p>
