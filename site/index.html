    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I love spending time with my wife and kids. I'm into cars and racing. I like woodworking and doing projects around the house. I love electronics and circuit design and microcontroller programming. I love building web applications and websites and teams that build web applications and websites. Mostly I just love building things, that's probably the simplest way to say it. If you want to build something cool with me get in touch!</p>

  <section class="disclaimer">
    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I'm a great engineer, but I'm not great at making things pretty, which is why I work with others. This site, as you can tell, is not pretty, sorry about that. I hand-rolled it myself; it's <em>artisan</em>! &#128521; Could I have built this in React or Rails or any number of other frameworks or systems? Sure. Could I have used Tailwind or Bootstrap or Material UI or any other library for components? Sure. But I've been intending to build this site for years and I haven't done that, so in an effort to build <em>something</em> I wrote a small, simple HTML document.</p>

      <h3>Discuss</h3>
      <p>Discuss is a simple forum application that I built to learn more about Ruby on Rails and React. It's a simple forum application that allows users to create topics and posts, and reply to posts. It's a work in progress, but it's a fun project that I'm using to learn more about the technologies I'm using. I run it in a docker container on a raspberry pi that sits behind my desk.</p>

      <h3>Why I'm Not Coding Tonight</h3>
      <p>Why I'm Not Coding Tonight is an Eleventy Blog to normalize not coding every night inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/kvlly/status/1395153003938725892" target="_blank">this tweet</a> from Kelly Vaughn. I run it on Github pages.</p>

      <h3>Burn Baby Burn</h3>
      <p>Burn Baby Burn is a cool open source project I found on GitHub to track the expense of a meeting based on its duration and the number of people involved. I started using it and it was good, but there were some features that I wanted (like adding and removing people after a meeting has already started, resetting, and keeping a history), and as I looked through the code I realized I would need to refactor the codebase to get those features implemented, so I forked and did that and opened up a (non-merged) pull request against the original with my changes. I run it on GitHub pages.</p>

      <h3>Newsletter Signup</h3>
      <p>At a previous employer we were evaluating whether to use Netlify to deploy one of our applications (conclusion: Netlify is an amazing tool built by a great company and you should totally use them, but in a larger org you have to balance the cost against the number of teams that would take advantage of it and that particular employer opted not to move forward with them). In order to do the evaluation I built a small newsletter signup application utilizing Next.js with Netlify functions (essentially like AWS serverless functions) and a FaunaDB database as a service backend. Neat project, lots of fun to build, everyone got a chuckle. The company was car-focused and most of what they were dealing with was the very top-end, show winner beautiful masterpieces, so I took the opposite approach. The newsletter never existed, so no point in signing up, just a proof-of-concept.</p>
